# Map Animation

## Project

Hello.

In this Project, the MBTA bus data was used to determine stops
between Harvard and MIT. Then, an animated marker was added on the
map to highlight the bus routes.

## How to run

To run this project, first you must generate a private key in [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/)

Mapbox is an open-source platform that allows you to create and display maps on a web page. The mapboxgl JavaScript library is part of the Mapbox ecosystem. It allows you to add all sorts of customizations to the map. For example, you can add a marker at a specific location on the map.

Once you have generated your key, copy and paste it in the key variable and load the files in your browser.
